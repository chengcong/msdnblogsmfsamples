## MFCopy

[MFCopy.exe](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mf/2009/12/16/mfcopy/) - This is a command line tool showcasing the Windows 7 Media Foundation source reader and sink writer APIs. This tool copies multimedia files from one multimedia container to another. Copying can involve simply remultiplexing the streams, transcoding to convert the streams to a different format.
